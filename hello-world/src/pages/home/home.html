        I'm David Nguyen and I'm a 5th Year SE student. I have a lot of experience in web app development,
        especially with Angular. However, the learning doesn't stop there. There is so much more to learn about web, like the Ionic Framework
        that's being used to build this very website. My main objective for this course is to get out of my comfort zone
        a little and fill in the knowledge gaps I got from self-teaching web app development.
